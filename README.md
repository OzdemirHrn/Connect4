# Connect4  
I implemented the Connect-Four game (text-based interface) and an AI player for this game. Both players begin with 21 identical pieces, and the first player to achieve a line of four connected pieces wins the game. For AI player, I implemented minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms with 3 evaluation functions.
